### When is the RSVP deadline?

Please [RSVP](#rsvp) now!

### Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?

Both the ceremony and reception will be indoors with the reception in a
non-air-conditioned pole barn in the country. The reception location has plenty
of outdoor space to explore with grass paths and gravel lanes.

### What should I wear?

You know us ;)! We care more about that you're there than about what you wear!
Search wedding casual or wedding dressy casual to get an idea of what most of
our guests will probably be wearing.

### What time will the reception end?

The bride and groom plan to leave at 8 pm. You're welcome to stay longer!

### Are kids welcome?

Yes, we'll have some games and activities at the reception for the kids - and
for the young-at-heart if you want to join in! ;)

### Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the wedding?

Yes! We would love for you to take photos and share them with us if you want!

### Who should I contact with questions?

Please reach out to maid-of-honor, Hannah 815-900-2053, if you have any
additional questions!
